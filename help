#Time calculations:
	1) Gross, or Raw WPM (Words Per Minute) is a calculation of 
	exactly how fast you type with no error penalties. The gross 
	typing speed is calculated by taking all words typed and 
	dividing by the time it took to type the words in minutes.
	2) To calculate Net WPM, take your gross WPM result and 
	subtract the amount of errors you left in per minute, 
	also known as the error rate.
