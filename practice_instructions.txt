************Tips before you take up the practice session*************
		 
1) The practice lesson window shows the text to be typed as it is at 
   the topmost part of page.
2) Typing area for the learner is provided below. Beofre you reach the
   typing window, you will be asked to choose from amongst the two 
   typing modes- Type ignoring corrections or Allow corrections using 
   backspace.
3) The indication of the wrongly typed character is shown by a highlight 
   of '^' character and by a beep sound(for that, you need to check your
   beep settings, use HELP option to know how to change beep settings).
4) Typing speed is enhanced only when you use the proper fingers to type 
   the appropriate character from the keyboard. The practice lessons also 
   provide you a keyboard layout which shows the hand and the finger to be
   used to type every character of your text as the typing proceeds.
