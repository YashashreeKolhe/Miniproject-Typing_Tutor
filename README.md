  1) Typing Tutor calculates the typing speed in wpm.
  2) Typing tutor shows the net speed, gross speed, accuracy, total characters typed, number of incorrectly typed characters, number of correctly typed characters. On completing the text, the above statistics are displayed at the right-bottom corner of the window.
  3) The practice sessions have two choices of typing methods named- "Type after correcting" and "Type without correcting".
In "Type after correcting", you can correct the wrongly typed characters using BACKSPACE and then continue typing. Whereas in "Type without correcting", you have to neglect the wrongly typed character and catch up with the next character from the text given for typing.
    eg: if the text is- 
      'Dick and Julian are interested'
      and if you type-
      'Dick and Juk'
      then it will display on the screen-
      'Dick and Ju^'
      the next character the learner should type is-
      'Dick and Ju^ian are interested'
  4) In practice session window, a replica of the QWERTY keyboard is shown at the bottom. It guides the learner to type the character key with appropriate finger and hand. The window shows the sketch of left and right hand with the acronyms for every finger and colour convention for each hand. There is a indicator shown on the key of the next character to be typed. The learner should understand the conventions and place the appropriate finger on his/her keyboard.
  5) This typing tutor can also be accessed through command line. To know more about command line handling of the tutor, type the command '$./project -h' on the terminal.
