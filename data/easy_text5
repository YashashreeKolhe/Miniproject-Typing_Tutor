Wikipedia is created and updated on the principle of co-operation. 'Vandalism' is a problem for Wikipedia. Some people with bad intentions distort or remove the information from the articles. Therefore, the main page and some other pages on WIikipedia are 'protected'-no one can make changes in them.
