	LEARN NUMERIC TYPING
 	Numeric Keypad Lessons

The Learn numeric typing lessons are provided for practice with the
numeric keys available on the H89/H19 terminal. You do not need to 
know how to touch type on the standard keyboard in order to learn 
touch typing on a calculator keypad. So, you can begin this series 
right away.When entering numeric values, accuracy is usually more 
important than speed. Take these lessons very slowly.  Speed will
come naturally later. As with the standard keypad, you must start 
in the HOME position.  Place the first three fingers of your right hand
over the 4, 5, and 6 keys of the keypad. (Your thumb and fifth finger 
are not used.) Your fingers should be poised just over the keys gently 
brushing them. Use the thumb or any finger of your left hand for other 
keys, such as the SPACE bar.
 	After entering each line, hit the ENTER key with the 6-finger 
 (the third finger of your right hand). Immediately return your finger 
 to the 6 key. It is important to bring the finger back without looking.

** Make sure the NUM LOCK is switched on(For Touch Type keypad).
