	Touch Typing Technique

Touch typing improves typing speed and accuracy. A touch typist never 
looks at the keyboard. The fingers hit the right keys by force of habit.
The typist is entirely focused on the text being typed, reading the words 
and phrases as the fingers type the text reflexively. Touch typing can be 
learned by performing special exercises.
	Stage one of the process begins with learning the home row of the 
keyboard (the row beginning with the Caps Lock key). Looking at the keyboard 
is strictly forbidden. This is followed by learning the lower and upper rows, 
the numbers row, upper-case letters and special symbols.
	Stage two involves memorizing frequently used syllables and typing 
words containing these syllables.
	Stage three involves typing actual text to perfect the skills acquired.
